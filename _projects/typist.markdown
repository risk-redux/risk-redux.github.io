 Information categorization is prerequisite to just about everything related to risk management, but _[NIST SP 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-60/vol-1-rev-1/final)_ is not ideal for searching through various data types. We created `typist` to support some simple searching capabilities (poorly) and provide a simpler organization of all the interconnected information.
